transforms a tuple with a number of arrays and/or matrices into a contiguous
memory space.

    Args:
      dir: Direction for catenation (X, Y or Z)
      tup: Tuple containing whatever has to be sent to NumPy's function.

    Returns:
      Concatenad arrays.

    Note:
      Separate functions for catenating in "x", "y" and "z" directions
      are also defined.  They require fewer arguments being passed and
      shorter syntax.  This function, however, is still usefull in
      instances in which the catenating direction is not predefined.
