      nx: Number of cells (one less than nodes) in "x" direction.
      ny: Number of cells (one less than nodes) in "y" direction.
      nz: Number of cells (one less than nodes) in "z" direction.
      dx: Three-dimensional matrix holding "dx" for all cells.
      dy: Three-dimensional matrix holding "dy" for all cells.
      dz: Three-dimensional matrix holding "dz" for all cells.
      rc: Resolution tuple (nx, ny and nz) for centered variable.
      rx: Resolution tuple (nx, ny and nz) for variable staggered in "x".
      ry: Resolution tuple (nx, ny and nz) for variable staggered in "y".
      rz: Resolution tuple (nx, ny and nz) for variable staggered in "z".

    Note:
      Cell resolutions are for one smaller than node resolutions for each
      direction.  Staggered cell resolutions are smaller than centered.
