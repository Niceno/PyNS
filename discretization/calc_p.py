  """
  Args:
    p:    Pressure unknown (created with "pyns.create_unknown" function)
    uvwf: Tuple with three staggered velocity components (where each 
          component is created with "pyns.create_unknown" function.
    rho:  Three-dimensional matrix holding density for all cells.
    dt:   Time step.
    dxyz: Tuple holding cell dimensions in "x", "y" and "z" directions.
          Each cell dimension is a three-dimensional matrix.
    obst: Obstacle, three-dimensional matrix with zeros and ones.  It is
          zero in fluid, one in solid.

  Returns:
    none, but input argument p is modified!
