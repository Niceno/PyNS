  """
  Args:
    uvw:  Tuple with three staggered or centered velocity components 
          (each component is created with "create_unknown" function.
    p:    Unknown holding the pressure correction.     
    rho:  Three-dimensional matrix holding density for all cells.
    dt:   Time step
    dxyz: Tuple holding cell dimensions in "x", "y" and "z" directions.
          Each cell dimension is a three-dimensional array.
    obst: Obstacle, three-dimensional matrix with zeros and ones.  It is
          zero in fluid, one in solid.
    
  Returns:
    none, but input argument uvw is modified.
