    Args:
      phi:  Unknown (created with "pyns.create_unknown" function)
      c:    Coefficients in system matrix.
      obst: Obstacle, three-dimensional matrix with zeros and ones.  It is
            zero in fluid, one in solid.
      obc:  Obstacle's boundary condition (NEUMANN or DIRICHLET).

    Returns:
      c: Modified system matrix.

    Note:
      The format of the system matrix is clear from function: "create_matrix"
